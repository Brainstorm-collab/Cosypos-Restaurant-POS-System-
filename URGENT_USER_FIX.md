# 🔧 URGENT: Fix for user@cosypos.app Permissions

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The USER role now has access to:
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Menu (view-only)
- ✅ Orders (view-only)
- ✅ Reservations (view-only)

The database has been updated with the correct permissions.

## 🚨 WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW

### **Option 1: Log Out and Log Back In (RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Click the profile icon** in the top right
2. **Click "Log Out"**
3. **Wait for redirect** to login page
4. **Log back in** with:
   - Email: `user@cosypos.app`
   - Password: `user123`

This will give you a fresh authentication token with updated permissions.

### **Option 2: Hard Refresh**

If logging out doesn't work:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. This forces a complete page reload
3. Then try logging out and back in

## 📋 Expected Result

After logging back in, you should see these menu items in the sidebar:
- 🎯 Dashboard
- 🍔 Menu
- 🛒 Order/Table
- 📅 Reservation

All pages will be **view-only** for the USER role (no add/edit/delete buttons).

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

If you still can't see the pages after logging out and back in:

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Take a screenshot** of any errors
3. **Check the console** for messages about permissions
4. **Let me know** the error messages

## 🔍 Technical Details

### What was wrong:
- Backend default permissions had `menu: false` for USER role
- Database had old permissions cached

### What was fixed:
- Updated backend default permissions (`menu: true`)
- Updated database for existing user
- Added session refresh notification banner
- Added clear alerts when permissions change

### Why re-login is needed:
- The JWT authentication token contains user info
- The token doesn't automatically update when database changes
- Logging out and back in gets a fresh token with new permissions from database

## 📝 Notes for Admin

When you update a user's permissions in the **Manage Access** page:
- The user will see an **alert** telling them to log out and log back in
- A **session refresh banner** will appear prompting them to re-authenticate
- This ensures permission changes take effect immediately
